# 🧬 Portfolio Optimization with Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains a **two-stage optimization approach** for portfolio optimization using Python.

The first stage applies the **Markowitz Mean-Variance Model** to generate an initial portfolio solution,  
which is then refined in the second stage using a **Genetic Algorithm** to achieve better optimization results.
